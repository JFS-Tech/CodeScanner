# CodeScanner - Adapted for the JFS Tech Mobile App

This package was created by Paul Hudson and adapted by JFS Tech developers as we wanted some custom and changed features.

## October 2023 Update

My developer license has expired and currently, I do not feel the need to renew it. This project is not needed by any currently running JFS Tech or StageMaster projects. It will be abandoned until another version of the app is created. Currently, it looks like this feature will be implemented into the web app.
